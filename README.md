## Technologies Used

* HTML 
* CSS 
* Javascript
* Webpack
* Babel
* esLint
* npm
* Jest
* Bootstrap

## Description
Test driven development using classes and Jest. 

### Objectives 

A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. However, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. For instance, a solar year on Mercury lasts 88 days. Write an application that determines a user's age based on a planet's solar years.

### Goals
The business logic of your application should take a person's age in years and create a class that does the following:

* Returns their age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
* Returns their age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
* Returns their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
* Returns their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
* Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planetâ€¦ (yikes!) app will calculate the user's life expectancy. If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this [repo](https://github.com/QuietEvolver/super-galactic-age-calculator.git) to your workspace.
* Navigate to the top level of the directory.
* open up a terminal console and type in $ npm install
* run $ npm run build
* run $ npm run start
* Open localhost:8080/ in your browser
